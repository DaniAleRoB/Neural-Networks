    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are not treated in this work as black-box models, but as architectural components whose structure introduces specific inductive biases into the learning process.\n",
    "This notebook explores convolutional layers as a principled design choice for image-based data, analyzing how architectural decisions affect performance, efficiency, and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of following a fixed recipe, we work with a real-world dataset and design both a baseline non-convolutional model and a convolutional architecture from scratch.\n",
    "Through controlled experiments, we evaluate how specific aspects of convolutional layers influence learning outcomes.\n"

    "It contains RGB satellite images labeled into multiple land-use categories, making it well-suited for convolutional architectures due to its strong spatial structure and texture-based patterns.\n"

    "- Perform a minimal exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the EuroSAT dataset.\n",
    "- Implement a baseline neural network without convolutional layers.\n",
    "- Design and justify a convolutional neural network architecture.\n",
    "- Conduct a controlled experiment on a specific convolutional layer parameter.\n",
    "- Interpret the results from an architectural and inductive bias perspective.\n",

    "Before working with the dataset and defining any models, we import the core libraries required for data handling, visualization, and neural network construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is based on **PyTorch**, which provides low-level control over neural network components, making it suitable for analyzing architectural decisions rather than relying on high-level abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The imported libraries support the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical computation and data manipulation\n",
    "- Visualization of images and training metrics\n",
    "- Dataset loading and preprocessing\n",
    "- Definition and training of neural network models\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we configure the computation device (CPU or GPU) to ensure compatibility across local and cloud-based environments such as Amazon SageMaker.\n"
